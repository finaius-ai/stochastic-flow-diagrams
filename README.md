# Implementation of stochastic flow diagrams for modeling macro capital flows

# Problem

Modern math has advanced greatly. But the tools we used to make discoveries in the field of finance are still very crude. Just like how Feynman diagram created a framework of understanding quantum eletrodynamics systems, can we utilize topology and graphs to further our understanding of economics and the financial market?

Topoogy and Graph Theory are widely used to study complex systems . Stochastic Flow Diagram is a topoloical representation that provides a way to visualize what otherwise would  a morass of equations in differences.
